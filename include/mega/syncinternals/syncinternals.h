 * matching two different files with reused FSIDs), we compare the file fingerprints.
 * The fingerprint provides a heuristic based on file properties like size and
 * modification time. While there is a small chance that a moved file with simultaneous
 * changes could mismatch (causing a reupload), this is far less harmful than mixing two
 * different files and losing data.
 *
 * This check is limited to FILENODE because fingerprints only exists for them.
 * Folder nodes (FOLDERNODE) generally do not have meaningful
 * fingerprints as their state is determined by their contents rather than intrinsic
 * properties.
 * Besides, for folders is much less common to have replacements or delete&create flows,
 * so the FSID alone is usually sufficient for detecting moves.
